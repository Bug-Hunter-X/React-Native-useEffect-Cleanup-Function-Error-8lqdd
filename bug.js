This error occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with a cleanup function that throws an error.  This commonly happens when the cleanup function attempts to access or modify a component's state or props after the component has unmounted.  For example:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = someDataStream.subscribe(data => setSomeState(data));

  return () => {
    subscription.unsubscribe(); //Error thrown here if component unmounted
  };
}, []);
```

If the component unmounts before `subscription.unsubscribe()` is called, the `subscription` might be null, undefined, or already unsubscribed, resulting in an error.
